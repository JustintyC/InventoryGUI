# **Gaming Inventory GUI**

## Description
This application provides a GUI that can potentially be 
implemented into a game that requires an inventory storage 
system. As someone who has plenty of experience in video games,
their development has given me great interest. This project 
will aim to provide me with experience in the development of
GUI, as well as potentially providing others with inspiration
on how to develop their own inventory system.

## User Stories
### As a user, I want to be able to:

- Clearly view the inventory

- Automatically organize inventory 
- Load save slots or create a new one
- Manually save data
- Option to save or not save data when quitting

TAs please grade the user stories marked with a *
